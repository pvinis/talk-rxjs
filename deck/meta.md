Hello, my name is Pavlos. Writing code is my hobby and my job. I enjoy making things that work, work well, work easy, mostly in that order!

# title
Using rxjs with React Native

# abstract
You can use rxjs to replace redux/mobx/whatever else. Let rxjs manage your local state and anything else. This allows the UI and the logic(rxjs) to be tested separately. This talk will be showing off some simple components and some screen components that we can control with rxjs. Mostly a demo talk.
